                            <p>DiCA is a tool which enables women entrepreneurs to evaluate their capacity gaps in applying ICT for business development and management. It is intended to assess basic ICT skills, ICT usage for general and business purposes, and ICT mindset. Based on the result, women entrepreneurs will be introduced to available ICT learning programmes to help them further enhance their ICT competency.</p>

                        <p>•	The Women First Advertisement Service, a key part of the programme, enables women entrepreneurs to sell their handicrafts and products on one of Turkey’s biggest online marketplaces, sahibinden.com using an easy-to-understand mobile application.&nbsp;<br>•	Through SMS messages, they can send information about their products to a third party organization,&nbsp;funded by Vodafone, which verifies the information and then posts an advert online on their behalf. To encourage more women to subscribe, the service also provides promotional offers and information services on topics such as child health and wellbeing. &nbsp;</p>

Producing and designing my work was time consuming and I had to spend most of my day travelling to neighbouring villages and cities to sell my artwork. Thanks to Women First Mobile Advertisement Service, I started to advertise my work through my mobile phone which triggered my sales. Joining the service allowed me to save time, money, run my business effectively and get access to a wider consumer group. Ultimately, my earnings increased approximately by 500%. ”</i><br><br>•	The programme won two Communitas Awards; for Corporate Social Responsibility and Community Service. &nbsp;</p></div></div></div></div>

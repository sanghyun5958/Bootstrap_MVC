                        <h4>RSV is an ‘enterprise resource planning and information management application’ for mobile phones (both smartphone and normal phones) which was developed for SEWA (Self-Employed Women’s Association of India) and their pioneering initiative, RUDI (Rural Distribution Network) which buys, processes and sells rural agricultural products in India. </h4>

                        <h3>Details</h3>
                        <p>•	Before RSV, rural saleswomen of SEWA RUDI placed the orders via word-of-mouth and recorded on paper, which often made them to travel up to 7 hours to place orders and collect stock. There were also many losses due to mismatched orders<br>•	Using RSV application on mobile phones, RUDI saleswomen can place orders, track inventory and manage their businesses. The orders are also instantaneously displayed on computers at RUDI’s processing centres, enabling RUDI to manage inventory and distribution more efficiently<br>•	RSV was developed jointly by SEWA, the Cherie Blair Foundation for Women and the Vodafone Foundation in India. Ekgaon Technologies, a rural services platform provider in India, was hired to develop the software and provide technical expertise. &nbsp;</p>

                        <p>•	To date over 2,500 illiterate and semi-literate women from remote rural &amp; desert prone villages have been trained to use the application. RSV has increased women’s business options, household nutrition and food security. 97% of the interviewed RUDI saleswomen saw a growth in customers and would recommend RSV to others<br>•	The project received additional grant from GSMA Connected Women Innovation Fund in December 2013 and the application won ‘Best Mobile Product in Emerging Markets’ at the 2014 Global Mobile Awards.&nbsp;</p>

                        <h3>About SEWA RUDI</h3>
                        <p>SEWA operates in 14 states in India helping over 1.9 million informal women entrepreneurs and women workers. Established in 2004, SEWA RUDI programme buys agricultural products from marginal farmers at fair market price, processes and packages them at a central factory and then sells directly to consumers through a network of local sales women called RUDI bens.</p>

                        <h3>Previous problems </h3>
                        <p>The expansion of RUDI’s operations outgrew their informal supply chain management systems. Orders were made by word-of-mouth and recorded on paper, with RUDI women often travelling up to 7 hours to place orders and collect stock. This paper-based system made it difficult for RUDI to anticipate demand and manage inventory. RUDI estimated 20-30% of potential sales were lost as orders went unfulfilled as end customers sourced goods from alternative suppliers. This not only impacted the RUDI women’s sales and income but also the 3,000 farmers who sell their produce to RUDI. </p>

Data is transmitted via inexpensive SMS (rather than data/3G services) to the server and the web-enabled backend is accessible to RUDI management via a browser in the processing centres.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="section">

                        <h3>Approaches Used   </h3>
                        <p>RSV has been developed specifically for RUDI, by working directly with the women entrepreneurs in the network to understand the information required to successfully place an order and manage their own business (e.g. recording customer sales and transactions). The application was initially trialed and adapted following a small-scale pilot. Other principles include: 1) Embedding the user in the design, 2) Mitigating the literacy burden, 3) Leveraging women’s social circle and 4) Supporting self-learning.  </p>

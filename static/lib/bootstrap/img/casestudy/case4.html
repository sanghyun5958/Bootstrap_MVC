                        <h3>What does it do? </h3>
                        <p>•	Myanmar currently faces a number of issues related to maternal health, among which include a high infant and maternal mortality rate and significant levels of baby malnutrition. With over 70% of births occurring without any professional medical service, information about maternal and child health is scarce among young parents, pregnant women and their families.<br><br><br>•	To solve these issues, Maymay app provides the following services:<br>&nbsp; -	<b>Maternal health advice notifications:</b> Users of the app receive 3 maternal health advice alerts per week, tailored to the stage of the user’s pregnancy.<br>&nbsp; -	<b>Doctor locator service:</b> The app uses the user’s GPS location and a database of Burmese healthcare professionals to provide users with information on, and the location of, their nearest healthcare worker through Google Maps.<br>&nbsp; -	<b>User profile:</b> Users of the app are required to enter details of their last menstrual period or expected due date in order for the notifications to be timed with the stage of their pregnancy. Messages are also adapted for whether or not it is the user’s first pregnancy, and the user can switch notifications on and off at any time.&nbsp;<br><br>•	To ensure that this information is credible the advice is obtained from the Mobile Alliance for Maternal Action (MAMA) and approved by Myanmar's Ministry of Health prior to dissemination, and kept relevant through the localization and translation of texts by PSI's Myanmar doctors.&nbsp;<br><br>•	It is free and can be accessed on iOS and Android phones&nbsp;</p>
